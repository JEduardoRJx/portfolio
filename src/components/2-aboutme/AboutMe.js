            Originally from Mexico, Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a passion to create, design, and build eye-catching applications. My background helping immigrants and other under-served populations during my time at Denver Public Library made me realize we can create friendlier, more accessible, and easier to use applications. I graduated from Turing School of Software and Design with an emphasis on Front-End Engineering and I strive to make a positive impact by solving challenging problems.
